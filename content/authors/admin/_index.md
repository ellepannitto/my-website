I am currently the NLP Lab Manager at [Laboratorio Sperimentale](https://site.unibo.it/laboratorio-sperimentale), a research lab set up at [LILEC, University of Bologna](https://lingue.unibo.it) and equipped with state-of-the-art hardware and software for experimental, computational and applied research in the fields of linguistics, translation and cultural studies. The current Scientific Coordinator of the Lab is prof. [Francesca Masini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesca.masini).

Before this, I got my PhD at [CIMeC](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/) - [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), under the supervision of [Aur√©lie Herbelot](https://aurelieherbelot.net/).

My research interests are Computational Construction Grammars, Cognitive Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

On the side, I am studying to become Italian Sign Language interpreter and I would very much like to bring this interest of mine into my research as well.

Everything in life is a _work-in-progress_, this place especially.
