* "The word in language is half someone else’s. It becomes one’s _own_ only when the speaker populates it with his own intentions, his own accent, when he appropriates the word, adapting it to his own semantic and expressive intention.", Mikhail Bakhtin

* "Analyzing the relation between language and thought is a bit like trying embrace a cloud. It is hard to know if you are dealing with reality or illusion, and if the former is assumed, it is hard to know if you have discovered something significant or are merely putting into words something that is already perfectly obvious to everyone" - Langacker, R. W. (1976). Semantic representations and the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Foundations of language, 307-357.

* "La scuola tradizionale ha insegnato come si deve dire una cosa. La scuola democratica insegnerà come si può dire una cosa, in quale fantastico infinito universo di modi distinti di comunicare noi siamo proiettati nel momento in cui abbiamo da risolvere il problema di dire una cosa" - Tullio De Mauro, Scuola e linguaggio. Roma: Editori Riuniti, 1981
