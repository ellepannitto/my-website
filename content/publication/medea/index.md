abstract: "The great majority of compositional  models  in  distributional  semantics present methods to compose distributional vectors or tensors in a representation of the sentence.   Here we propose to enrich the best performing method (vector addition, which we take as a baseline) with distributional knowledge about events, outperforming our baseline."
