  abstract  = {While neural embeddings represent a popular choice for word representation in a wide variety of NLP tasks, their usage for thematic fit modeling has been limited, as they have been reported to lag behind syntax-based count models. In this paper, we propose a complete evaluation of count models and word embeddings on thematic fit estimation, by taking into account a larger number of parameters and verb roles and introducing also dependency-based embeddings in the comparison. Our results show a complex scenario, where a determinant factor for the performance seems to be the availability to the model of reliable syntactic information for building the distributional representations of the roles.},
