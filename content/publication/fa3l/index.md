abstract: "In this paper we present ThReeNN, a model for Community Question Answering, Task 3, of SemEval-2017. The proposed model exploits both syntactic and semantic information to build a single and meaningful embedding space. Using a dependency parser in combination with word embeddings, the model creates sequences of inputs for a Recurrent Neural Network, which are then used for the ranking purposes of the Task. The score obtained on the official test data shows promising results."
