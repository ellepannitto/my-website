abstract: "This paper presents a novel framework for evaluating Neural Language Models’ linguistic abilities using a constructionist approach. Not only is the usage-based model in line with the underlying stochastic philosophy of neural architectures, but it also allows the linguist to keep
meaning as a determinant factor in the analysis. We outline the framework and present two possible scenarios for its application."
