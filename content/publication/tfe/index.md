abstract: "While neural embeddings represent a popular choice for word representation in a wide variety of NLP tasks, their usage for thematic fit modeling has been limited, as they have been reported to lag behind syntax-based count models.  In this paper, we propose a complete evaluation of count models and word embeddings on thematic fit estimation,  by taking into account a larger number of parametersand verb roles and introducing also dependency-based embeddings in the comparison.  Our results show a complex scenario,  where a determinant factor for the performance seems to be the availability to the model of reliable syntactic information for building the distributional representations of the roles"
