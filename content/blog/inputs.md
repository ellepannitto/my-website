_4Jun2020_:
So, today my department has decided to have an online seminar. The whole word in sharing links and improving access to talks and resources in any possibile way. And yet, here at cimec, we have a sort of complex identification procedure to be able to listen to the talk. Privacy, recording, I honestly don't know what the reason is, but whatever the reason it seems totally unreasonable to deliberately make it difficult to participate, to restrict knowledge to the elite. I hate this place every day a bit more.

_23apr2020_:
Highligh of the one-by-last lesson of the famous cose: "There's some religion going here". Of course, the other theory always seems religion.
And of course, this university "doesn't like" students taking exams just for personal enhancement, without study plans and papers signed. What an awful awful place I'm in.

_02apr2020_:
The thruth is, I genuinely don't like my project. I don't like coding neural nets, they make me anxious and make me feel helpless in front of complicated and obscure frameworks. A terrible stomachache gets me each time I open the damn terminal, the same I got when they asked me to reharse a performance I didn't want to do. And also, I don't see why I'm doing it, it looks like a convoluted thought exercise that no one will ever care about. I can't wait to drop out of this nightmare.

_30mar2020_:
Yesterday it has been one of the most awul days ever. My own issues absorbed me for the whole day, then I started thinking: I haven't received basically any word from the director of our PhD. The only email is from two weeks ago and it was a very informal one. I myself am kilometers from home, but I am one of the luckiest persons, being in my own country with my normal life going on, however virtually, besides the PhD. I feel sorry for my colleagues, who are thousands of kilometers away from their families, time zones apart. It's all so prosaic but I wonder whether a more personal, warm email could have made us feel home, maybe more than organizing pointless christmas parties.

_25mar2020_:
Highlights from the day: 
* in a few hours it's Lucio's birthday. I'm so sorry he has to spend the day in quarantine. I guess he'd rather be with someone else, in some other place. I'm sorry he's stuck here with me
* we got a paper at a workshop where no one wants to go and we don't even know if it will be held at the moment. Other papers from my ""group"" have been accepted, but they apparently don't know mine is there too.
* I've been asked to write the code for my master thesis again, but it takes time and I guess they won't be happy if I spend time this way. Actually, I'd like to spend time on useful and interesting things, like writing some even small code to help in the coronavirus situation, or go out and go shopping for those who can't. But I feel so extremely guilty because I should be working instead as if nothing is happening. That makes me sick.
* I should keep in mind to turn on discord in the morning. At least some friendly faces are there, and give me some sort of reason to keep working.

_19mar2020_:
Our quarantine is going on. It's starting to feel very hard to bear. I cook a lot, tidy up, feel mainly depressed. And trying to make the most out of this time. I should be coding, but I just don't feel like it. And the university is acting really cold, and slow. I'd so much love to be somewhere else.

After dinner, dad's day is almost over, I feel guilty. I haven't even bought a gift, this year, for the covid situation. But I baked some croissants. Also, I got an email about an upcoming conference (who cares about conferences in this moment anyway) and I realized I haven't been invited to review, while some of my friends are there. This shouldn't affect me but somehow I feel touched. I know I'm not enough, I can't wait to be out of this world. The croissants were good, maybe they'll bring me somewhere safer.

_09mar2020_:
Today is definitely a bad day. I've been in a bad mood since this morning. Might be because Lucio is about to leave. Or because I really really hate coding neural networks.
In the afternoon my supervisor wrote to me, saying that I can now to work from home for the coronavirus situation in Italy. But what does it mean? Am I supposed to be in the office otherwise? I spend most of my time home, and I like it this way. I don't need more psychological pressure.

_03mar2020_:
Today I'm completely freezed again. Now I know that Lucio is leaving in 8 days, and I totally can't see the reason to be here, nor the reasons to go back. I feel like Mindy St. Claire, I should start behaving like her.

After lunch, Lucio asked me: "Do you want me to stay here in Rovereto?". I learned to realize how paradoxical is my stay here. I couldn't say yes, how can I prevent him from living his life, that's the least of the things I want. I couldn't say no, should I lie about the fact that I want to build a stability together somewhere, plan the next 10 years rather than the next 3 weeks, think about how life will be like?

I went to lesson today, there's this course, about innatism, I've been asked to follow. And it's actually probably a good thing, so that I can make my arguments about innatism a little more systematic. The thing is, there's a moodle plaform for the course, for materials and announcements... and I discovered today that we, phd students, cannot access these pages by default, I had to specifically ask the administration to grant me access. Yet another reason to why this place is disgusting, PhD students are not really considered students, access to resources is not a priority, they keep talking about how cool it is to be so multidisciplinary, and then things are mostly closed most of the times. I feel so super ashamed of be part of this place.

_02mar2020_:
I got an email from my department today, advertising free weekly tango lessons to take place inside the main building. Surely, it will be for research purposes, surely there will be plenty of reasons for offering these classes but, I quote, "Classes will be [...] reserved for UniTN staff and students". Has the writer thought about this sentence? Was there really no possibility to include the community?
There are loads of things that I don't get or agree on, speaking about managing a university, but this one really bugs me. And it happens here in Rovereto much more often than it used to happen in Pisa. And people seem to be completely ok with it. 
It splits the community, it bites up a piece of your personal life without giving you the possibility of sharing it with someone else, reinforcing that fake idea of friendship and relationships that we have in academia. I don't want the university to be "mine", I don't want to be inside if someone ends up being on the outside, whatever the reason.

_01mar2020_:
It is sunday and it is raining in Rovereto. I am working and looking out of my window, and I feel like I'm working out of guilt, when I should definitely be working out of joy.

_28feb2020_:
Yesterday I had a couple of hours of concetration. It was nice, I got an idea. It will probably be useless and full of flaws, but it's been nice to be able to think.
Today I've woken up crying. It's been nice, but it feels so far away.

_26feb2020_:
I am reading (yet another) paper on innateness. _Ex nihilo, nihil fit_, it says. Seems like a perfect description of my life lately. Maybe it's all part of the innatists plan to make me a little more innatist.

After lunch, I'm still just crying in front of my laptop with no progress done. I feel like I should drop out of PhD and go take a flight to India tomorrow morning, spend three months with buddhist monks in a complete eat-pray-and-love fashion. Why am I not brave enough to hand in that stupid dropout form?

Before dinner, I went out to get an ice-cream because the situation was getting out of hand and I needed a break. And hey, it kind of worked.
Then, Lucio was called on the phone, he's going back to Pisa in two weeks. I've known it for months now, but it's so hard to think of a new routine in this place, it's already been to hard to get this one running.

_25feb2020_:
I've just finished having a chat with my supervisor. We couldn't meet in person because of the collective coronavirus panic, so it has been a written chat.
Now, these conversations have slowly become the most frustrating experiences of my life. It felt like starting from scratch again, and it always feels so.
It's been more than one year now. Each time, I try to make a step outside of the little square I'm standing on, each time I believe in my plan of movement, each time it's not fine for some reason I don't get and we're speaking of things that seem so unrealted, to my issue and to one another. And then each time I'm back on the same square, each time I believe in myself a little less, each time I'm less and less sure about which direction is interesting, each time I feel like the only thing I'm able to do is to stay still on that tiny square. I'll maybe sit down, I'm starting to feel deeply uncomfortable here. I need to sit down.
