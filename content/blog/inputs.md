Hence this place: it is private, but not isolated. Opinions are my own. Also, yes, my English is bad._"

Today I'm completely freezed again. Now I know that Lucio is leaving in 8 days, and I totally can't see the reason to be here, nor the reasons to go back. I feel like Mindy St. Claire, I should start behaving like her.

I got an email from my department today, advertising free weekly tango lessons to take place inside the main building. Surely, it will be for research purposes, surely there will be plenty of reasons for offering these classes but, I quote, "Classes will be [...] reserved for UniTN staff and students". Has the writer thought about this sentence? Was there really no possibility to include the community?
There are loads of things that I don't get or agree on, speaking about managing a university, but this one really bugs me. And it happens here in Rovereto much more often than it used to happen in Pisa. And people seem to be completely ok with it. 
It splits the community, it bites up a piece of your personal life without giving you the possibility of sharing it with someone else, reinforcing that fake idea of friendship and relationships that we have in academia. I don't want the university to be "mine", I don't want to be inside if someone ends up being on the outside, whatever the reason.

It is sunday and it is raining in Rovereto. I am working and looking out of my window, and I feel like I'm working out of guilt, when I should definitely be working out of joy.

Yesterday I had a couple of hours of concetration. It was nice, I got an idea. It will probably be useless and full of flaws, but it's been nice to be able to think.
Today I've woken up crying. It's been nice, but it feels so far away.

I am reading (yet another) paper on innateness. _Ex nihilo, nihil fit_, it says. Seems like a perfect description of my life lately. Maybe it's all part of the innatists plan to make me a little more innatist.

After lunch, I'm still just crying in front of my laptop with no progress done. I feel like I should drop out of PhD and go take a flight to India tomorrow morning, spend three months with buddhist monks in a complete eat-pray-and-love fashion. Why am I not brave enough to hand in that stupid dropout form?

Before dinner, I went out to get an ice-cream because the situation was getting out of hand and I needed a break. And hey, it kind of worked.
Then, Lucio was called on the phone, he's going back to Pisa in two weeks. I've known it for months now, but it's so hard to think of a new routine in this place, it's already been to hard to get this one running.

_25feb2020_:
I've just finished having a chat with my supervisor. We couldn't meet in person because of the collective coronavirus panic, so it has been a written chat.
Now, these conversations have slowly become the most frustrating experiences of my life. It felt like starting from scratch again, and it always feels so.
It's been more than one year now. Each time, I try to make a step outside of the little square I'm standing on, each time I believe in my plan of movement, each time it's not fine for some reason I don't get and we're speaking of things that seem so unrealted, to my issue and to one another. And then each time I'm back on the same square, each time I believe in myself a little less, each time I'm less and less sure about which direction is interesting, each time I feel like the only thing I'm able to do is to stay still on that tiny square. I'll maybe sit down, I'm starting to feel deeply uncomfortable here. I need to sit down.
